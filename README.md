# TradeASkill Platform ü§ù

A peer-to-peer platform where individuals can exchange skills and knowledge directly without involving money. Teach what you know, learn what you need, and build a community around shared learning.

---
## ## Description

The TradeASkill Platform is a web application designed to connect people who want to learn a new skill with others who can teach it, based on a mutual exchange. For example, a user who can teach graphic design can get matched with someone who can teach guitar lessons. It's a non-monetary, community-driven approach to personal growth and learning.

This project was built as a front-end application using fundamental web technologies, with a focus on clean code, responsive design, and a clear user flow.

## ## Example Flow

1.  **User A** signs up. They list "Python Programming" as a skill they can teach and "Photography" as a skill they want to learn.
2.  **User B** signs up. They list "Photography" as a skill they can teach and "Python Programming" as a skill they want to learn.
3.  The system identifies them as a potential match.
4.  They connect via the platform to schedule sessions.
5.  After the swap is complete, both users can leave feedback and ratings for each other.
